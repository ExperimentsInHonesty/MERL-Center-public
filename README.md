# Welcome to the MERL Center
The MERL Center is an interdisciplinary community that is creating resources for [monitoring, evaluation, research and learning (MERL)](https://github.com/MERLTech/MERL-Center-public/blob/main/MERLdefinition.md) practitioners to understand if, how, and when to use open source solutions. The MERL Center is a part of the larger [MERL Tech](https://merltech.org) community and is organized and funded by GitHub's Social Impact, Tech for Social Good team, with support from TCC Group. [You can read more about the MERL Center here.](https://socialimpact.github.com/insights/collaboration-power-merl-center/)

## What's in this repo?
This is the public repository of the MERL Center on which publicly available learning content and the code for the forthcoming MERL Center website are hosted. MERL Center members collaborate on the MERL Tech GitHub organization (account) through two repositories - this public repo and a repo that is only for members. Anyone who wishes to propose and contribute a new piece of content must go through a basic onboarding process and become a MERL Center member, which is free of charge. MERL Center members must have some experience in MERL and/or open source. Anyone - regardless of MERL Center membership - can access and fork published MERL Center content on this public repository. Currently, only MERL Center members can propose changes to content with pull requests, though this may open up to more people in the future.
