# Welcome to the MERL Center

The MERL Center is a website to help Monitoring, Evaluation, Research and Learning (MERL) practitioners understand if, how and when to use open source software, data and tools as part of their MERL solutions

Founded in September 2019 by the Tech for Social Good program of [GitHub Social Impact](https://socialimpact.github.com) and [Kurante/MERL Tech](http://merltech.org), the MERL Center materials are conceptualized, produced, edited and open sourced by dedicated, cross-disciplinary working groups.
