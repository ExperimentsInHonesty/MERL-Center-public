*Any content created for the MERL Center must abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MERLTech/MERL-Center-public/blob/master/How-to-Contribute/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).*

## Text

### Voice

- Language should be clear, professional, and jargon-free (or jargon-defined). 
- Avoid using flowery language e.g. endless adjectives
- Use narrative non-fiction to engage readers or emphasize a point. Avoid using narrative fiction.
- **Case studies** -  use a persuasive voice to convince the reader of an argument. Be clear if an argument is based in opinion or fact, or quantitative or qualitative data. 
- **Beginner's Guides** - present a balanced view of options, research, tools, etc. For example, present pros/cons of tools instead of advocating for a tool without context.

### Grammar

Use third person, present tense wherever possible. Case studies may be best written in first person.

### Length

There is no specific requirement on length. Sections in case studies and beginner's guides should be as succinct as possible, avoid repetition and be modular i.e. can read as standalone text.
