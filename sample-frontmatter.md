The above text is frontmatter that should be inserted at the top of every learning content piece. Without this frontmatter, the post will not appear correctly on the website. Below is an explanation of how to fill out each field. **Note that if certain characters like colons or semi-colons appear in a field, they may cause a website display error.**

#### `layout: blog-post`
Do not change this field

#### `title:`
Add in your title. 

#### `authors:`
Leave the space after the colon blank. The fields below `authors` should be filled out. Note an unlimited number of authors can appear on a piece of learning content, though we generally encourage no more than four be listed. 

#### `- author:`
Write the full name of the primary author as it should appear on the website. Example: John Smith or Mala Kumar

#### `authorTitle:`
Write the title
